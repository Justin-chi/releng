2 add public keys to the ansible server's authorized_keys
server:192.168.172.12
client:192.168.127.13

scp /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 192.168.127.13:/root/.ssh/12712.pub
ssh_options="-o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no"
sshpass -p root ssh $ssh_options root@192.168.127.13 "cat ~/.ssh/12712.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
