E.g. 
192.168.101.2 is the ip address of Jenkins-slave node, a server or computer you want to install jenkins on it.

just few steps below you need to run on your jumphost, that can access all of your Jenkins-slave nodes

1.ssh-keygen
2.ssh-copy-id root@192.168.101.2
3.modify hosts file to add the server you want to install
4.ansible-playbook -i hosts playbook.yml

if I am server/client:
  cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

if there are more than one Jenkins-slave node, excute 1-3 steps repeatly for each node.
